# Abstract app

## Description
Small python application that retrieves plain text abstracts and basic metadata (title and authors) from a list of DOI of academic works via [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) API. It takes as input a csv or xlsx file with a column of DOI (with or without url) and produces either a csv or xlsx sheet with the abstract, title, and authors of these works if available.
