# Abstract app

## Description
Small python application with a graphical user interface that retrieves plain text abstracts and basic metadata (title and authors) from a list of DOI of academic works via [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) API. 
## How does it work?
The app takes as input a csv or xlsx fi, with a column of DOIs (with or without url) and produces either a csv or xlsx sheet with the abstract, title, and authors of these works if available.
